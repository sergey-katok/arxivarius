arxivarius is a web interface to view dirs/files on your harddrive.
It shows the files mp3 tags if any. 
Translates names of the dirs/files into russian from translit alphabetically/by patterns
or using translations stored in the database table 'translit'.

arxivarius consists of ruby on rails application (APP) and importer perl script (IMPORTER) lib/directory_tree.pl,
IMPORTER walks throgh all sub-directories of a specified directory and grabs all names into mysql database:
tables :directories, :fils (for files), :mp3tags
The importer reimports all data from scratch, there is no append functionality yet.
